<h3>What is <u>noit o' mnain worb</u>?</h3>

<p>The <u>noit o' mnain worb</u> language is a
non-deterministic particle automaton based on brownian motion (or entropy).

<p>A <u>noit o' mnain worb</u> runtime has an orthogonal gridwork
playfield (of any reasonable size or number of dimensions)
which is populated by any number of <i>bobules</i>.  Bobules are <i>solid</i>
elements in this grid - that is, no two bobules may occupy the same location.
Bobules are also capable of motion - in fact they can hardly avoid it - and it is
important to note that they are stateless.  As such, they have no idea which
direction they are going, nor what they are going to do when they get there.</p>

<p>Each time quantum, or <i>tick</i>, each bobule chooses an adjacent square
to move to, at random (in two dimensions, that's 8 possibilities
plus the possibility of not moving = 9 possibilities.)
If, during some tick, this randomly-chosen new location does not allow entry -
that is, if it is already occupied by a solid element (a bobule or a wall) - the
bobule does not move during that tick.</p>

<p>[Implementation note: each tick that a bobule is blocked from moving,
its "pressure" increases, although this is merely for visual effect.]</p>

<p>The playfield is made more interesting by the addition of:
<ul>
<li> <tt>#</tt> <i>walls</i> which are merely static solid elements that take up space and do not move;
<li> <tt>^v&gt;&lt;</tt> <i>diodes</i> which disallow bobules from passing through them backwards;
<li> <tt>+-</tt> <i>sources & sinks</i> which represent large repositories or vacancies of bobules; and
<li> <tt>!</tt> <i>loads</i> which represent something that the bobules can 'do'.
</ul></p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>[Historical note: In version 1.0 (Jul 5 2000) of the language, which was released only
on the Cat's Eye Technologies Mailing List,
<tt>+-</tt> had much different (and much more myopic)
semantics than they do in v1.1.]</p>

<p>The sources and sinks are simply convenient 'macros', so that you can
build something like:</p>

<pre>
  ###
###+###
</pre>

<p>instead of saying something like:</p>

<pre>
#######
#.....#
#.....#
#.....#
###.###
  #.#
###v###
</pre>

<p>Using the <tt>+</tt> sources and <tt>-</tt> sinks simply saves you
from specifying large chambers of bobules or emptiness explicitly.</p>

<p>[Implementation note: It is not the intention of the <tt>+</tt> element
to violate entropy, but the fact that, in the reference implementation, <tt>+</tt>
keeps producing bobules indefinately at a uniform rate of 10% chance per tick
does bend the rules a bit.  In a more "entropically correct" implementation, the
chance per tick should decrease over time.  Note that the language proper
does not specify any particular rate of bobule creation, but encourages
implementations to be flexible on this point.]</p>

<p>The <tt>!</tt> loads simply cause the implementation to react in some
noticable way when a bobule enters into their location, so that the
<u>noit o' mnain worb</u> programmer can pretend to themselves that their
bobules are 'doing something' during program runs.</p>

<p>[Implementation note: The reference interpreter simply outputs an ASCII
BEL character when this happens.  On most terminals, this affects a beeping
sound.]</p>

<p>The idea is that the bobules, spaces, walls, and diodes alone constitute a (nearly)
Turing-Complete system.</p>

<p>I say "nearly" because it's actually missing a dimension in this form.  The
<u>noit o' mnain worb</u> language isn't dimensionally-independent.
Notably, it doesn't work in one dimension at all.</p>

<p>It <i>almost</i> works in two dimensions, but the fact is that if you do not address
the 'wire-crossing problem' (see <a href="/projects/befunge93/">Befunge-93</a>'s
<tt>#</tt> instruction), you cannot
guarantee being able to connect two arbitrarily-chosen paths in two dimensions.
You need to have a way for coincident paths to cross, which is not strictly
just two dimensions anymore.</p>

<p>[Theoretical note: we suspect, but would surely have a hard time proving,
that this limitation is somehow related to the four-colour map theorem.]</p>

<p>So, it really only works in three dimensions and above.  For that reason,
adding 'wormholes' to the <u>noit o' mnain worb</u> playfield is a possible
extension in the near future, to simulate three dimensions a la 'wire crossing'.</p>
